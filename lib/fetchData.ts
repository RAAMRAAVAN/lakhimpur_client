  "description": "Assam Cancer Care Foundation is a joint initiative between the Government of Assam and the Tata Trusts. It was set up in December 2017 to create a first-of-its-kind, three-level cancer grid in the state of Assam. The distributed care model was conceptualized by the Government of Assam and Tata Trusts to create patient-centric cancer care hospitals to deliver standardized and affordable care closer to patients' homes. With a plan to set up 17 cancer hospitals in the state of Assam, it is the largest cancer care network in South Asia. Of the 17 hospitals, Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated seven hospitals at Dibrugarh, Barpeta, Tezpur, Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Kokrajhar, and Darrang and also laid the foundation stones for seven more new cancer care hospitals at Nagaon, Goalpara, Nalbari, Golaghat, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, and Dhubri on April 28, 2022. Subsequently, two more hospitals at State Cancer Institute Guwahati and Silchar were inaugurated by Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam, Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma in March 2024. Construction works at Diphu and the seven new sites are currently in progress.",

There is also a specific psychosocial need of patients as well as their immediate caregivers. To equip nurses with specialised knowledge and skills in cancer care and treatment, it was essential to train nursing talent so that they can become champions in the cancer care delivery system.\n\nNFP programme was launched in July 2020, by the Tata Trusts and Assam Cancer Care Foundation (ACCF). The eleven-month long programme offers cancer nursing, treatment modalities, palliative care nursing, communication and counselling, and leadership lessons.",
